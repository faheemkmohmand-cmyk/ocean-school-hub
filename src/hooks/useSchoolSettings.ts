// FIX: Use supabasePublic instead of supabase for reading school settings.
// The authenticated supabase client can get stuck in an auth refresh loop
// when the session token is expired or broken — this causes the query to
// hang forever, and React Query keeps showing placeholderData (which has
// logo_url: null, banner_url: null). supabasePublic has no auth session
// management, so it never gets stuck. This is the same fix already used
// for the admission form (see supabase.ts comments).
